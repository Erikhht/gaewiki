Notes
=====

**GAEWiki** is a simple wiki engine written in Python, which runs in Google App Engine. It does not have as many features as some other wikis have, but it's sufficient to run a personal or a small community web site.  [Read more.](https://github.com/Erikhht/gaewiki/blob/wiki/Introduction.md)

**NOTE from author**: I'm no longer using Google App Enigne and the wiki.  I don't develop it anymore.  However, I'd be glad to apply your patches, if you send them to [hex@umonkey.net](mailto:hex@umonkey.net).  If you'd like to maintain the code â€” email me and I'll grant you access to the repository.  Thanks.
